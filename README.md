# Different_File_Formats
### Access to Notebook
While the Jupyter Notebook's size is large, it is diffucult to render it on Github. Therefore, I uploaded and opened it on ReviewNB. You can check the project there, I am going to share URl link here --> [Differen File Formats file on ReviewNB](https://app.reviewnb.com/chatziserif/Different_File_Formats/blob/main/Different_File_Formats.ipynb)

### About the Project 
Firstly, we initialize different types of files which are Comma-separated values (CSV), JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), Microsoft Excel Open XML (XLSX), Extensible Markup Language (XML) and Binary File Formats. Then, we execute some basic data analysis which includes statistical overview and visualization.
